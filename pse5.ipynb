Calculate and print the number of bills of each denomination (twenties, tens, fives, and ones) that should be dispensed, minimizing the total number of bills used.

Your code, however, must include logic for every denomination (twenties, tens, fives, and ones). An easy way to approach this problem is with the use of floor division (`//`) and remainder (`%`) operations. In this example, the number of twenties needed is `94 // 20`, which gives 4. The remaining amount to be dispensed then is `94 % 20`, which is 14. The number of tens needed then is `14 // 10`, which gives 1. The remaining amount to be dispensed then is `14 % 10`, which is 4. The number of fives needed then is `4 // 5`, which gives 0 (so skip the output). The remaining amount to be dispensed then is `4 % 5`, which is still 4  but we know that should be dispensed as ones (since it's the lowest denomination left). "
